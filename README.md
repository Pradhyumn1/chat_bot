# Project: Simple Chatbot using PyTorch and NLP


Developed a simple chatbot using PyTorch and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries. The chatbot recognizes various intents such as greetings, booking requests, cancellations, and provides appropriate responses.

## Key Achievements:
- Dataset Creation: Built a dataset with Indian references, including greetings, inquiries about bookings, cancellations, and hotel information.
- Model Training: Implemented a neural network model using PyTorch to predict the intent of user queries based on bag-of-words representation.
- Training Pipeline: Created a robust training pipeline, including data preprocessing, model definition, and optimization.
- User Interaction: Developed a user-friendly interaction loop allowing users to communicate with the chatbot and receive relevant responses.
- Deployment: Deployed the chatbot for interactive use, enabling users to get responses to their queries in real-time.

### Technologies Used:
Python, PyTorch, NLP, Data Preprocessing, Neural Networks
